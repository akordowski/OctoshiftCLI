# OctoshiftCLI

[![Actions Status: CI](https://github.com/akordowski/OctoshiftCLI/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/akordowski/OctoshiftCLI/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

The purpose of this repository is to extract the code of the [gh-gei](https://github.com/github/gh-gei) (GitHub Enterprise Importer CLI) project and provide it as NuGet packages. In this way the base code can be reused while creating own migration extensions for the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation).
